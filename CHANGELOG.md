# Changelog

## 0.2.0

### CPU renderer
- Software rasterizer backend — no GPU required (`-Drenderer=cpu`)
- Interactive CPU demo via `wl_shm` Wayland buffers
- HarfBuzz shaping, COLR emoji, and composite group support in CPU path
- Image paint support in CPU renderer

### Rendering
- Tuned subpixel LCD filter weights to reduce color fringing
- Unified coordinate system to Y-down top-left origin

### Cleanup
- Removed dead `.snail` file format module
- Removed unused helpers and dead GPU timer module

## 0.1.0

Initial release.

### Text rendering
- Direct Bezier curve evaluation in the fragment shader (Slug algorithm) — no texture atlas rasterization
- Subpixel LCD antialiasing (RGB/BGR/VRGB/VBGR) with safe dual-source blending
- Grayscale AA fallback for rotated/scaled text
- HarfBuzz integration for full OpenType shaping (optional, `-Dharfbuzz=true`)
- Built-in GSUB/GPOS shaping and kerning when HarfBuzz is disabled
- COLR/CPAL color emoji support
- Multi-font rendering via texture arrays (no atlas switching overhead)

### Vector paths
- Filled and stroked paths with analytic antialiasing
- Shape primitives: rect, rounded rect, ellipse, arbitrary cubic Bezier paths
- Paint types: solid color, linear gradient, radial gradient, image fill
- Even-odd and non-zero fill rules
- Frozen path pictures for static scene reuse

### API
- Zero-allocation batch API: caller owns vertex buffers, can pre-build static batches
- Shaped-run API for terminal/editor use (caller owns runs, snail owns shaping)
- C API with shared library (`libsnail.so` / `libsnail.a`) and pkg-config
- Zig package module (`zig fetch --save`)
- OpenGL 3.3+ and Vulkan backends

### Performance
- GL 4.4 persistent mapped buffer path when available
- Comptime-gated CPU profiling timers
- Benchmarks against FreeType + HarfBuzz
